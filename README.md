## Problem Statement
With the advent of ChatGPT, chatbots are great tools to facilitate studentâ€™s learning process by resolving their queries 24/7 with multilingual support. Furthermore, they provide personalisation by recommending course content according to oneâ€™s progress, engagement, magnitude of interest. Not just that, but they also assist client organisation by augmenting their audience pool.

We aim to create chatbots that subsidise the studentsâ€™ pain-points as well as expand the studentâ€™s knowledge.

Before the advent of technology, students were unable to gain knowledge and key solutions at the moments of doubt. Hence, urging students to leverage this advanced benefits is our drive. This will also aid educational organisations to maximise their reach as well as revenue, creating a win-win situation on both ends. 

Simply, tackling this problem statement will lead to massive growth for the education industry, benefit the overall organisation-student interaction, improve the online learning environment and augment business.
